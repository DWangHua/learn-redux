#### 1. The Single Immutable State Tree (*Principal #1*)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree

The **first principal** to learn in Redux is that you are going to represent your whole
application ("State") as a single JavaScript Object. All changes and mutations
to the state in Redux are *explicit* so it is possible to keep track of all of them.

In this video Dan shows how the state of a Todo app changes over time as
data is added and filters applied; its a *glimpse* of power of the single state tree.

<br />

#### 2. Describing State Changes with Actions (*Principal #2*)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-describing-state-changes-with-actions

The **second principal** of Redux is that the **state tree** is ***read-only***;
you cannot modify or write to it, instead, any time you want to change the state
you need to dispatch an action. (i.e. *you can only "update" the state using a function*...)
An action is a *plain Javascript Object* describing the change.
Just like the state is the minimal representation of data in your app,
the action is the minimal representation of the change to that data.
The only requirement of an action is that it has a `type` property
(*this more a description for your action*). The convention is to use a `String`
because they are serialisable (*i.e. easy to `JSON.stringify`*)

> "*Any data that gets into your Redux Application gets there by actions*"

#### 3. Pure and Impure Functions

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-pure-and-impure-functions

Pure functions depend solely on the values of the arguments.
Pure functions do not have any (*observable*) side-effects such as network
or database calls. Pure functions just calculate the new value [of the state].

The functions you write in redux need to be pure.

####Â 4. The Reducer Function (*Principal 3*)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-reducer-function

The UI/View layer of an application is most predictable when it is described
as a pure function of the application state. Pioneered by ~~React~~ [Ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) and now addopted by several other
frameworks, Redux compliments this approach with another idea:
the state mutations in your app need to be described as a pure function
that takes the previous state and the action being "dispatched" (*performed*)
and returns the next state of your app.

Inside any Redux app there is one function that takes the state of the whole
application and the action being dispatched and returns the next state of
the whole application. It is important that it does not modify the state given
to it; it has to be pure, so it has to `return` a new `Object`
Even in *large* applications there is still just a simple function
that manages how the next state is calculated based on the previous state
of the whole application and the action being dispatched.
It does not have to be slow, for example: if I change the visibility filter
I have to create the new object for the whole state, but I can keep the
reference to the previous version of the Todo's array because the list of
todos has not changed when we change the visibility filter; this is what makes
Redux fast.

> this is the 3rd and final principal of Redux: to describe state changes
you have to write a function that takes the previous state of the app
and the action being dispatched and returns the next state.
The function has to be pure and is called the "Reducer".

#### 5. Writing a Counter Reducer with Tests

This video walks through creating a basic counter in Redux.

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-writing-a-counter-reducer-with-tests

The first [*and only*] function in this video is the Reducer for the counter example.
A reducer accepts state and action as arguments and returns the next state.

Before writing any code, we write a few assertions (*tests*) using
[**Michael Jackson**](https://github.com/mjackson)'s
(*Yes, there's a developer with that name...*)
***Expect*** (testing/assertion) **library**: https://github.com/mjackson/expect

We assert that when the state of the counter is zero and you pass an `INCREMENT`
action, it should return 1.

```js
expect (
  counter(0, { type: 'INCREMENT' })
).toEqual(1);
```

And similarly when the counter is 1 and we `INCREMENT` it should return 2.

```js
expect (
  counter(1, { type: 'INCREMENT' })
).toEqual(2);
```

We add a test that check how `DECREMENT` works; from 2 to 1 and from 1 to zero:

```js
expect (
  counter(2, { type: 'DECREMENT' })
).toEqual(1);

expect (
  counter(1, { type: 'DECREMENT' })
).toEqual(0);
```

If we run these tests [*in the browser*], they will fail because we have not
even *begun* to implement the reducer.
We are going to start by checking the action type.
If the action type is `INCREMENT` we are going to `return state + 1` (*state plus one*)
If the type is `DECREMENT` we are going to `return state - 1` (*state minus one*)

```js
if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
  return state + 1;
} else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
  return state - 1;
}
```

If you run the tests, you will find that that this is enough to get them to pass.

However, there are still some flaws in our implementation of the counter reducer.
If we dispatch an action that it [*the reducer*] does not understand,
it should return the current state of the application.

```js
expect (
  counter(1, { type: 'SOMETHING_ELSE' })
).toEqual(1);
```

However if we check for that, we will see that this test fails
because we currently don't handle unknown actions.
So I'm going to add an `else` clause that returns the current state
and the tests pass now.

```js
if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
  return state + 1;
} else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
  return state - 1;
} else {
  return state;
}
```

And the tests pass now.

Another issue is that while the reducer is in control of the application state,
*currently* it does not specify the initial state; in the case of the counter
example that would be zero.

The convention in Redux is that if the reducer receives `undefined` as the
`state` argument, it *must* `return` what it considers to be the inital
`state` of the application. In this case it will be zero.

"*Now come a few* ***cosmetic tweaks***" ... At the end of the video Dan replaces
the `if/else` blocks with a `switch` statement* - which we *agree* is *neater* (*and works in* ***all browsers***)

```js
switch (action.type) {
  case 'INCREMENT':
    return state + 1;
  case 'DECREMENT':
    return state - 1;
  default:
    return state;
}
```

*However* Dan *also* makes a couple of changes which are *not* just "*cosmetic*":
changing the reducer function to be an **ES6**
[`Arrow Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and also includes an **ES6** [`default parameter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters)
syntax to specify what the state should be if its undefined.

The reducer function written in ES5 (*Works in* ***ALL Browsers***):
```js
function counter(state, action) {
  state = state || 0; // default parameter assignment before ES6
  /* reducer code here */
}
```
is re-written using ES6 features: (***Only Chrome*** *fully-supports both these new features*)

```js
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  /* reducer code here */
}
```

***Arrow functions*** can be fewer characters to type but are
[***not supported***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Browser_compatibility)
in **Safari** *or* **Internet Explorer**
[*at the time of writing*] ...  
![ES6-arrow-functions-not-supported-in-safari-or-internet-explorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12050430/5800888c-aeed-11e5-91fb-0bb8ff2ae4a4.png)

***Default parameters*** are a *nice* addition to JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015) because
they make it clear what the default value of the parameter should be if its unset,
however they are
[***not supported***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters#Browser_compatibility) in **Internet Explorer**, **Safari** *or* **Opera** [*at the time of writing*] ...
![es6-default_parameters-browser_compatibility](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12050412/095e590c-aeed-11e5-8dae-a8a4105715fb.png)

These browsers still account for between 30%-50% of people using the internet in December 2015
(*depending on the age/geography of the people using your app...
see*:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers )
And considering that *most* people take *ages* to upgrade to the latest browser
Microsoft ***Internet Explorer 8*** *still has*
[***10%*** *market share*!](https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0)
and is [still available](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer-8-details.aspx)
to be downloaded.

using ES6 features has two implications:
+ If you want to run the code in a browser you need Google Chrome ***Canary***.
+ And/Or, You need to "*transpile*" (*convert*) your code using ***Babel*** before running it in browsers.

We will come back to Babel later...
