# Learn Redux

Learn how to use Redux to write Predictable / Testable web apps.

> Note: these notes are aimed at people who already have some JavaScript experience.

## Why?

Redux is a *logical* way to write *simplified* front-end web applications.
While there is an ***initial learning curve*** we feel the *elegance*
of the single store (*snapshot of your app's state*) offers a significant
benefit over other ways of organising your code.

> *Please, don't take my/our word for it,
skim through the notes we have made and*
***decide for yourself***.

## What?

Redux (the JavaScript Libarary - *not to be confused with
  https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework the PHP framework...*) *borrows the* ***reducer pattern*** *from*
[***Elm***](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
which simplifies writing web apps.

At the time of writing, the *minified* version of redux is 5.4kb and has


### Three Principals

#### 1. *Single* Source of Truth

The state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree; the "Store".
This makes it *much* easier to keep track of the "*State*" of your application
at any time and roll back to any previous state.


#### 2. State is *Read-Only* ("*Immutable*")

Instead of directly updating data in the store, we describe the update
as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version.

####Â 3. Changes are made Using *Pure Functions*

`(state, action) => state` see: [youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs?t=15m51s](https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs?t=15m51s)

To change the state tree we use "*actions*" called "*reducers*",
these are simple functions which perform a *single* action.
