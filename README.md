# Learn Redux

Learn how to use Redux to write Predictable / Testable web apps.

> Note: these notes are aimed at people who already have "***intermediate***" ***JavaScript experience***.  
> If you are just starting out on your programming journey, we recommend you read:  
> [https://github.com/nelsonic/***learn-javascript***](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-javascript)

and *then* come *back* here!  
> :star: this GitHub repo so you don't forget where it is!


## Why?

Redux is a *very* ***elegant*** way 
to **structure** JavaScript web applications.
While there is an ***initial learning curve*** we feel the *simplicyt*
of the *single* `store` (*snapshot of your app's state*) 
offers a ***significant***
**benefit** over other ways of organising your code.

> *Please, don't take our word for it,
skim through the notes we have made and*
***always decide for yourself***.

## What?

Redux<sup>1</sup> *borrows the* ***reducer pattern*** *from*
[***Elm*** Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
which simplifies writing web apps.
If you have *never heard of Elm*, don't worry,
you don't need to go read another doc before you can understand this...
Just keep reading this page and (*hopefully*) everything will become clear.


<sup>1</sup> <small> ***Redux*** *the JavaScript Library should not to be confused with the Redux Framework [PHP framework](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework)  
... naming collisions are inevitable in the world of code.
naming things is a [hard problem](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)*</small>

### Three Principals

Redux is based on three principals.  
see: http://rackt.org/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html

#### 1. *Single* Source of Truth

The state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree; the "Store".  
This makes it *much* easier to keep track of the "*State*" of your application
at any time and roll back to any previous state.

> If its not *intermediately* obvious why this is a good thing,
we *urge* you to have faith and keep reading...

#### 2. State is *Read-Only* ("*Immutable*")

Instead of directly updating data in the store, we describe the update
as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version.

> See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object

####Â 3. Changes are made Using *Pure Functions*

To change the state tree we use "*actions*" called "*reducers*",
these are simple functions which perform a *single* action.

#### tl;dr

Read more about JavaScript's Reduce (Array method):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce  
and how to reduce an array of Objects:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732043/javascript-reduce-on-array-of-objects  
understanding these two things will help you grasp why Redux is so simple.

You will see this abbreviated/codified as `(state, action) => state`

#### 25. Passing the Store Down Implicitly via Context

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-passing-the-store-down-implicitly-via-context

In the previous lesson we got rid of the top-level `store` variable 
and instead started passing the `store` as a `prop` to the `TodoApp` 
Component so *every* Component below received the `store` 
as a `prop`. And we even have to do this for *Presentational* Components 
because sometimes they contain *Container* Components 
that need the `store` to `subscribe` to the changes. 
We have to write a lot of "*boilerplate*" code 
to pass the `store` down as a `prop` 
but there is *another* way using the "*advanced*" React feature 
called "***Context***".

I'm creating a *new* Component called `Provider` 
and from its' `render` method it just returns what ever its' *child* is. 
So we can *wrap* any Component in a `Provider` 
and it's going to `render` that Component. 

```js
class Provider extends Component {
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

I'm changing the `render` call 
to render a `TodoApp` inside the `Provider` 
and I'm moving the `store` `prop` from the `TodoApp` 
to the `Provider` Component.

```js
ReactDOM.render( 
  <Provider store={createStore(todoApp)}>
  <TodoApp />,
  </Provider>
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The `Provider` Component will use the React 
*advanced* ***Context*** Feature to make the `store` 
available to *any* Component inside it 
including "*Grand Children*". 
To do this it has to define a special method called 
`getChildContext` that will be *called* by React. 
We are using `this.props.store` which corresponds to 
`store` passed to the `Provider` as a `prop` just *once*.
*this* `store` will be part of the *Context* 
that the `Provider` specifies 
for any "*Children*" and "*Grand Children*" 
so the `TodoApp` is going to receive this *Context* 
and any Component inside `TodoApp` is going to receive 
this *Context* `Object` with the `store` inside it. 
However there is an *important condition* for the *Context* to work, 
and this *condition* is that you have to specify 
`childContextTypes` on the Component that defines 
`getChildContext` these are just `React.PropTypes` definitions 
but *unlike* `PropTypes`, the `ChildContext` Types are ***essential*** 
for the *Context* to be turned on. 
If you don't specify them, no *Child* Components 
will receive this *Context*. 

The *Container* Components *currently* access `store` by `props` 
but we are going to change this to read the `store` from React *Context* 
and to do that we just refer to `this.context` 
similarly in the `render` method I'm also going to *read* the `store` 
from the *Context* instead of the `props`:

```js
const store = this.context.store; // no ES6 required.
```

*Finally* the *Context* is "*Opt In*" 
for the *receiving* Components *too* 
so you *have* to *specify* a special field called `contextTypes` 
which are *similar* to `childContextTypes` 
but in this case we are specifying which Context we
want to *receive* and not pass down. 

```js
VisibleTodoList.contextTypes = {
  store: React.PropTypes.object
}
```
If you *forget* to declare the `contextTypes` 
the Component will *not* receive the relevant Context 
so it is ***essential*** to remember to declare them.

What about the *functional* Components that don't have [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) 
(*JavaScript context*). 
It turns out that they *also* receive the Context 
but as a *second* argument *after* the `props` 
so I'm destructuring the *second argument* 
and getting the `store` from there 
and the *second argument* is the Context.
Just like with the `class` Components 
I still have to add a property called `contextTypes` 
that specifies which *Context* I want to receive 
and in this case I want to receive the `store` from the `Provider`. 
If I *forget* to declare the `contextTypes` 
my *functiona* Component will not receive the relevant *Context* 
as the *second argument*.

```js
AddTodo.contextTypes = {
  store: React.PropTypes.object 
}
```
So, its *important* to *remember* to declare them 
any time you *use* the *Context*.
*Finally* I'm replacing the `props` with the `context` 
when getting the `store` for the `FilterLink` 
and I'm adding the `contextTypes` declaration 
to the `FilterLink` so it receives the relevant *Context* 
from the `Provider`. 
Now that the `FilterLink` receives the `store` by `context` 
I no longer need to pass it as a `prop` 
so I'm removing its' usage (*from the `Footer` Component*)
and I'm also removing the `store` prop from the `Footer` 
because it doesn't need to pass it down anymore. 

I'm also removing the `store` prop from the `TodoApp` Component 
because I no longer need to pass it down to the *Containers*. 
Now instead of *explicitly* passing the `store` down 
by `props`, we pass it *implicitly* by `context`. 

Lets recap how we use the `context` to pass the `store` down:
We *start* by *rendering* the `TodoApp` 
inside the `Provider` Component we defined above. 
The `Provider` Component just *renders* 
what ever you pass to it 
so in this case it renders its' "*Children*" 
or [*more specifically*] the `TodoApp` component 
however it also provides the `context` 
to *any* Components inside it, including "*Grand Children*" 
the `context` contains just *one* key called the `store` 
and it corresponds to the `store` we passed as a `prop` 
to the `Provider` Component. 
We pass the `store` to the `Provider` Component in our `render` call 
and make it available to "*Child Components*" 
by defining the `getChildContext` with the `store` key 
pointing to that `prop`. 
It is ***essential*** that the `getChildContext` 
is matched by `childContextTypes` 
where we specifcy that the `store` key has `PropTypes` 
of `object`. 

> Note: that the `childContextTypes` definition 
is ***absolutely required*** 
if you want to pass the `context` down the tree. 

The benefit is that we don't need to pass the `store` 
through the *intermediate* components 
and instead we can declare the `contextTypes` 
on the *Container* Components that need access to the `store` 
so that they can retrieve it from the `context` 
instead of retrieving it from the `props`. 
The `context` creates something like a "*worm hole*" 
between the `VisibleTodoList` Component that reads the `context` 
and the `Provider` that *provides* the `context` 
and this "*worm hole*" is only *enabled* 
because the `contextTypes` declared ont he `VisibleTodoList` 
include the `store` that is defined in `childContextTypes` 
of the `Provider` Component. 

The `AddTodo` is another Component that needs *access* to the `store` 
so it also *opts-in* to receiving it in the `context` 
by specifying the `contextTypes` 
this is why in *addition* to `props`, 
it receives a *second argument* which is the `context` 
I'm using the *destructuring* syntax here so instead of:

```js
const AddTodo = (props, context) => {
const store = context.store; // need to manually assign the store from context
// rest of code ...
```
we get a simplified version:

```js
const AddTodo = (props, { store }) => {
// rest of code ...
```
The `context` works at *any* depth 
so it is not necessary to put `contextTypes` on the `Footer` 
the `FilterLink` is the Component that *directly* uses the `context` 
so this is the component that has to *specify* the `contextTypes` 
so that it can use the `store` by reading it from the `context`. 

Context is a *powerful feature* 
but in a way it contradicts the React philosophy 
of the ***explicit data flow***. 
The `context` essentially allows ***Global Variables*** 
across the Component Tree 
but ***Global Variables*** are *usually* a ***Bad Idea*** ... 
and unless you're using it for dependency injection 
like here where we need to make a *single* `Object` 
available to all Components, 
then probably you *shouldn't* use `context` ... 

*Finally* the Context API is ***NOT Stable*** in React! 
It has changed before and it is likely to change again 
so try your best not to rely on it too much.

## Notes:

At the time of writing, the *minified* version of redux is **5.4kb** and has
No Dependencies.
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux.svg)](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux)  
We like this. It means the Library is *self-contained* ("*stand-alone*") and you can read/understand it quite easily.

... Unidirectional Data Flow (*why is this better than bi-directional e.g: Angular.js*)
