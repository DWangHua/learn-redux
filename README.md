# Learn Redux

Learn how to use Redux to write Predictable / Testable web apps.

> Note: these notes are aimed at people who already have "***intermediate***" ***JavaScript experience***.  
> If you are just starting out on your programming journey, we recommend you read:  
> https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-javascript


## Why?

Redux is a *logical* way to write *simplified* front-end web applications.
While there is an ***initial learning curve*** we feel the *elegance*
of the single store (*snapshot of your app's state*) offers a significant
benefit over other ways of organising your code.

> *Please, don't take our word for it,
skim through the notes we have made and*
***always decide for yourself***.

## What?

Redux<sup>1</sup> *borrows the* ***reducer pattern*** *from*
[***Elm*** Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
which simplifies writing web apps.
If you have *never heard of Elm*, don't worry,
you don't need to go read another doc before you can understand this...
Just keep reading this page and (*hopefully*) everything will become clear.


<sup>1</sup> <small> ***Redux*** *the JavaScript Library should not to be confused with the Redux Framework [PHP framework](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework)  
... naming collisions are inevitable in the world of code.
naming things is a [hard problem](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)*</small>

### Three Principals

Redux is based on three principals.  
see: http://rackt.org/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html

#### 1. *Single* Source of Truth

The state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree; the "Store".  
This makes it *much* easier to keep track of the "*State*" of your application
at any time and roll back to any previous state.

> If its not *intermediately* obvious why this is a good thing,
we *urge* you to have faith and keep reading...

#### 2. State is *Read-Only* ("*Immutable*")

Instead of directly updating data in the store, we describe the update
as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version.

####Â 3. Changes are made Using *Pure Functions*

To change the state tree we use "*actions*" called "*reducers*",
these are simple functions which perform a *single* action.

#### tl;dr

Read more about JavaScript's Reduce (Array method):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce  
and how to reduce an array of Objects:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732043/javascript-reduce-on-array-of-objects  
understanding these two things will help you grasp why Redux is so simple.

You will see this abbreviated/codified as `(state, action) => state`

## How?


### *Video Tutorials* by Dan Abramov (*the Creator of Redux*)

The *fastest* way to get started with Redux is to watch the video tutorials
recoded by Dan Abramov (Creator of Redux) for
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

We have made a set of *comprehensive* notes:
[egghead.io_**video_tutorial**_***notes***.md](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/master/egghead.io_video_tutorial_notes.md)

If you have them open while you are watching the videos you can 
go a lot faster. 
*Please* give feedback and suggest improvements by creating issues on GitHub: 
https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/issues 
*Thanks*!

#### 9. Avoiding Array Mutations with concat(), slice(), and ...spread

In this video we learn how to avoid mutating arrays using concat(), slice(), and the ES6 array spread operator.

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-avoiding-array-mutations-with-concat-slice-and-spread

"In this lesson I use the *expect* library to make assertions 
and [**deep-freeze**](https://github.com/substack/deep-freeze) to make sure my code is ***free*** *of* ***mutations***."

```js
    <script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/expect@latest"></script>
    <script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/deep-freeze@latest"></script>
```
These are loaded from [@Substack](https://github.com/substack)'s CDN: https://wzrd.in

"Let's say that I want to implement a **counter** ***list*** application.
I would need to write a few function that operate on its' state and
its' state is an `Array` of JavaScript *Numbers* representing the individual counters."

The first function I want to write is called addCounter
and all it should do is to *append* a zero at the end 
of the passed `Array`.


```js
const addCounter = (list) => {
  
};

const testAddCounter = () => {
  const listBefore = [];
  const listAfter  = [0];
  expect(
  	addCounter(listBefore)
  ).toEqual(listAfter);
}

testAddCounter();
console.log('All tests passed.');
```

At first I use the [`Array.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) 
method.

At the time of writing, the *minified* version of redux is 5.4kb and has
No Dependencies. 
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux.svg)](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux)
We like this. It means the Library is *self-contained* ("*stand-alone*") and you can read/understand it quite easily.

... Unidirectional Data Flow (*why is this better than bi-directional e.g: Angular.js*)
