# Learn Redux

Learn how to use Redux to write Predictable / Testable web apps.

> Note: these notes are aimed at people who already have "***intermediate***" ***JavaScript experience***.  
> If you are just starting out on your programming journey, we recommend you read:

## Why?

Redux is a *logical* way to write *simplified* front-end web applications.
While there is an ***initial learning curve*** we feel the *elegance*
of the single store (*snapshot of your app's state*) offers a significant
benefit over other ways of organising your code.

> *Please, don't take our word for it,
skim through the notes we have made and*
***always decide for yourself***.

## What?

Redux<sup>1</sup> *borrows the* ***reducer pattern*** *from*
[***Elm*** Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
which simplifies writing web apps.
If you have *never heard of Elm*, don't worry,
you don't need to go read another doc before you can understand this...
Just keep reading this page and (*hopefully*) everything will become clear.


<sup>1</sup> <small> ***Redux*** *the JavaScript Library should not to be confused with the Redux Framework [PHP framework](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework)  
... naming collisions are inevitable in the world of code.
naming things is a [hard problem](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)*</small>

### Three Principals

Redux is based on three principals.  
see: http://rackt.org/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html

#### 1. *Single* Source of Truth

The state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree; the "Store".  
This makes it *much* easier to keep track of the "*State*" of your application
at any time and roll back to any previous state.

> If its not *intermediately* obvious why this is a good thing,
we *urge* you to have faith and keep reading...

#### 2. State is *Read-Only* ("*Immutable*")

Instead of directly updating data in the store, we describe the update
as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version.

> See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object

####Â 3. Changes are made Using *Pure Functions*

To change the state tree we use "*actions*" called "*reducers*",
these are simple functions which perform a *single* action.

#### tl;dr

Read more about JavaScript's Reduce (Array method):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce  
and how to reduce an array of Objects:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732043/javascript-reduce-on-array-of-objects  
understanding these two things will help you grasp why Redux is so simple.

You will see this abbreviated/codified as `(state, action) => state`

## How?


### *Video Tutorials* by Dan Abramov (*the Creator of Redux*)

The *fastest* way to get started with Redux is to watch the video tutorials
recoded by Dan Abramov (Creator of Redux) for
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

We have made a set of *comprehensive* notes:
[egghead.io_**video_tutorial**_***notes***.md](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/master/egghead.io_video_tutorial_notes.md)

If you have the notes open while you are watching the videos you can
go a *lot* faster.  

*Please* give feedback and suggest improvements by creating issues on GitHub:

*Thanks*!


#### 16. Implementing combineReducers() from Scratch

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-implementing-combinereducers-from-scratch

In the previous lesson we learned to use the `combineReducers` function
which comes with Redux and generates one reducer
from several other reducers
delegating to them parts of the `state` tree.

To gain a *deeper* understanding of how *exactly* `combineReducers` works
we will *implement* it ***from scratch*** in this lesson.

`combineReducers` is a function so I'm writing a function declaration
and its' only argument is the *mapping* between `state` keys
and the reducers, so I'm just going to call it `reducers`.

```js
// const { combineReducers } = Redux;
const combineReducers = (reducers) => {
  return (state = {}, action) => {
    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(
      (nextState, key) => {
        nextState[key] = reducers[key](
          state[key],
          action
        );
        return nextState;
      },
      {} // empty initial nextState
    );
  };
};
```

The returned value is supposed to be a reducer its' self
so this is a function that returns another function
and the signature of the returned function is a reducer signature
it has the `state` and the `action`
now I'm calling the [`Object.keys` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) (*IE9+*) 
which gives me all the `keys` of the `reducers` `Object`
in our example this is `todos` and `visibilityFilter`
next I am calling the (Array) `reduce` method on the `keys`
because I want to produce a *single* value such as the `nextState`
by *accumulating* over every reducer `key`
and calling the *corresponding* reducer
each reducer passed to the combined reducers function is only responsible
for updating a *part* of the `state` 
this is why I'm saying that the `nextState` by the given `key`
can be calculated by calling 
the *corresponding* reducer by the *given* `key` with 
the *current* `state` by the *given* `key` 
and the `action`
the `Array.reduce` wants me to `return` the *next* accumulated value
from the callback so I am returning the `nextState` 
and I'm also specifying an *empty* `Object` as the *initial* `nextState`
*before* all the `keys` are processed. 
And there we have it this is a *working* re-implementation of 
`combineReducers` utility from Redux

Lets *recap* how it works.

## Notes:

At the time of writing, the *minified* version of redux is **5.4kb** and has
No Dependencies.
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux.svg)](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux)  
We like this. It means the Library is *self-contained* ("*stand-alone*") and you can read/understand it quite easily.

... Unidirectional Data Flow (*why is this better than bi-directional e.g: Angular.js*)
