# Learn Redux

Learn how to use Redux to write Predictable / Testable web apps.

## Why?

Redux is a *logical* way to write *simplified* front-end web applications.
While there is an ***initial learning curve*** we feel the *elegance*
of the single store (*snapshot of your app's state*) offers a significant
benefit over other ways of organising your code.

> *Please, don't take our word for it,
skim through the notes we have made and*
***always decide for yourself***.

## What?

Redux<sup>1</sup> *borrows the* ***reducer pattern*** *from*
[***Elm*** Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
which simplifies writing web apps.
If you have *never heard of Elm*, don't worry,
you don't need to go read another doc before you can understand this...
Just keep reading this page and (*hopefully*) everything will become clear.


<sup>1</sup> <small> ***Redux*** *the JavaScript Library should not to be confused with the Redux Framework [PHP framework](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework)  
... naming collisions are inevitable in the world of code.
naming things is a [hard problem](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)*</small>

### Three Principals

Redux is based on three principals.  
see: http://rackt.org/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html

#### 1. *Single* Source of Truth

The state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree; the "Store".  
This makes it *much* easier to keep track of the "*State*" of your application
at any time and roll back to any previous state.

> If its not *intermediately* obvious why this is a good thing,
we *urge* you to have faith and keep reading...

#### 2. State is *Read-Only* ("*Immutable*")

Instead of directly updating data in the store, we describe the update
as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version.

####Â 3. Changes are made Using *Pure Functions*

To change the state tree we use "*actions*" called "*reducers*",
these are simple functions which perform a *single* action.


<br />

#### tl;dr

Read more about JavaScript's Reduce (Array method):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce  
and how to reduce an array of Objects:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732043/javascript-reduce-on-array-of-objects  
understanding these two things will help you grasp why Redux is so simple.

You will see this abbreviated/codified as `(state, action) => state`

## How?


### *Video Tutorials* by Dan Abramov (*the Creator of Redux*)

The *fastest* way to get started with Redux is to watch the video tutorials
recoded by Dan Abramov (Creator of Redux) for
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

We have made a set of *comprehensive* notes:
[egghead.io_**video_tutorial**_***notes***.md](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/master/egghead.io_video_tutorial_notes.md)

If you have the notes open while you are watching the videos you can
go a *lot* faster.  

*Please* give feedback and suggest improvements by creating issues on GitHub:

*Thanks*!

#### 11. Writing a Todo List Reducer (Adding a Todo)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-writing-a-todo-list-reducer-adding-a-todo

Just like in the previous two lessons, I'm using the 
**expect** library to make test assertions and
**deep-freeze** library to *prevent accidental mutations* in my code.

In this lesson I will create a reducer for a Todo-list application
who's state is described as an array of Todos.

Just to remind you what a reducer is: its a "*pure function*" 
you write to implement the update logic of your application.
That is how the next state is calculated given the current state
and the action being disptched.

Before writing a reducer I want a way of knowing whether its code is correct. So I'm starting by writing a test for it:


```js
const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  	
};

const testAddTodo = () => {
  const stateBefore = [];
  const action = {
  	type: 'ADD_TODO',
  	id: 0,
  	text: 'Learn Redux'
  }
  const stateAfter = [
  	{
  	  id: 0,
  	  text: 'Learn Redux',
  	  completed: false
  	}
  ];

  deepFreeze(stateBefore);
  deepFreeze(stateAfter);

  expect(
  	todos(stateBefore, action);
  ).toEqual(stateAfter);
};
```

I'm declaring two variables:
+ `stateBefore` - the state before, which is an *empty* `Array`
+ `action` - the action being dispatched - which is an action describing a user adding a new todo with some `id` and a `text` (*fields*).

I am also declaring the *state* I `expect` *after* calling the reducer.
and like `stateBefore` it is an `Array`, but this time it has 
a *single element* representing the Todo that was just added;
so it has the same `id` and `text` as the action `Object`.
and it *also* has an *additional* field called `completed` 
that I want to be *initialised* to be `false`

We want to make sure that the reducer is a "*pure function*",
so I am calling `deepFreeze` both on the `stateBefore`
*and* the `action`.

*Finally* I'm ready to use the `expect` library to verify that if I call
the todo reducer with the `stateBefore` and the `action`
I'm going to get the result that is ***deeply*** **equal** 
to the `stateAfter` I *just* declared.

## Notes:

At the time of writing, the *minified* version of redux is 5.4kb and has
No Dependencies.
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux.svg)](https://david-dm.org/rackt/redux)  
We like this. It means the Library is *self-contained* ("*stand-alone*") and you can read/understand it quite easily.

... Unidirectional Data Flow (*why is this better than bi-directional e.g: Angular.js*)
