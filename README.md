# Learn Redux

Learn how to use Redux to write Predictable / Testable web apps.

> Note: these notes are aimed at people who already have "***intermediate***" ***JavaScript experience***.  
> If you are just starting out on your programming journey, we recommend you read:  
> https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-javascript


## Why?

Redux is a *logical* way to write *simplified* front-end web applications.
While there is an ***initial learning curve*** we feel the *elegance*
of the single store (*snapshot of your app's state*) offers a significant
benefit over other ways of organising your code.

> *Please, don't take our word for it,
skim through the notes we have made and*
***always decide for yourself***.

## What?

Redux<sup>1</sup> *borrows the* ***reducer pattern*** *from*
[***Elm*** Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
which simplifies writing web apps.
If you have *never heard of Elm*, don't worry,
you don't need to go read another doc before you can understand this...
Just keep reading this page and (*hopefully*) everything will become clear.


<sup>1</sup> <small> ***Redux*** *the JavaScript Library should not to be confused with the Redux Framework [PHP framework](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework)  
... naming collisions are inevitable in the world of code.
naming things is a [hard problem](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)*</small>

### Three Principals

Redux is based on three principals.  
see: http://rackt.org/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html

#### 1. *Single* Source of Truth

The state of your whole application is stored in a single object tree; the "Store".  
This makes it *much* easier to keep track of the "*State*" of your application
at any time and roll back to any previous state.

> If its not *intermediately* obvious why this is a good thing,
we *urge* you to have faith and keep reading...

#### 2. State is *Read-Only* ("*Immutable*")

Instead of directly updating data in the store, we describe the update
as a function which gets applied to the existing store and returns a new version.

####Â 3. Changes are made Using *Pure Functions*

To change the state tree we use "*actions*" called "*reducers*",
these are simple functions which perform a *single* action.

#### tl;dr

Read more about JavaScript's Reduce (Array method):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce  
and how to reduce an array of Objects:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732043/javascript-reduce-on-array-of-objects  
understanding these two things will help you grasp why Redux is so simple.

You will see this abbreviated/codified as `(state, action) => state`

## How?


### *Video Tutorials* by Dan Abramov (*the Creator of Redux*)

The *fastest* way to get started with Redux is to watch the video tutorials
recoded by Dan Abramov = Creator of Redux for
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

<br />


#### 6. Store Methods: getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-store-methods-getstate-dispatch-and-subscribe

Video #6 picks up from where #5 finished, so if you skipped
video 5, go back and watch it, and try writing/running the code!

Dan starts off by showing how to include Redux (*from CDN JS*)
in a client-side app so we can start using the methods.
This is not the *recommended* way of loading Redux but works fine for this
example/demo.

"*In real applications I suggest you use npm and a module bundler like
webpack or browserify*".


In this tutorial we are using a single function from Redux called `createStore`

Using **ES6** [**destructuring assignment**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
syntax to extract the `createStore` method from Redux:

```js
const { createStore } = Redux;  // 6 fewer characters to type. OMG! what will we do with all that extra free time?!
// this is equivalent to:
var createStore = Redux.createStore;
```

"The store binds together the **3 Principals** of Redux,
it holds the current application state object, it lets you dispatch actions.
When you create it [the store] you need to specify the reducer that tells
how to update the state with actions.
In this example we are calling `createStore` with `counter` as the reducer
that manages the state updates."

Redux Store has **3** (*important*) **methods**:

+ `getState` - retrieves the current state of the Redux store. In the case of our counter the initial state is Zero.
+ `dispatch` - lets you dispatch actions to change the state of your application.
if we log the state of the application after dispatching an action (e.g: `INCREMENT`), we see that the state has changed to 1.
(*the most commonly used method*)
+ `subscribe` - lets you register a callback that the Redux store will call
any time an action has been dispatched. so you can update the UI of your application to reflect the current application state.

The code at the end of video #6 looks like this: (*explanatory comments added*)

At the time of writing, the *minified* version of redux is 5.4kb and has

... Unidirectional Data Flow (*why is this better than bi-directional e.g: Angular.js*)
